# Space Ninja

  The [color=#66FF00]Space Ninja[/color] is a ghost role randomly available mid-late game. If you pick it you will be given your gear, your objectives, and the greeting.

You are a ninja, but in space. The Spider Clan has sent you to the station to wreak all kinds of havoc, from bolting the armory open and killing the entire station to engaging in a slipping war with the clown and fighting in rage cages.

  Whether you mercilessly pick off the station's crew one by one or assassinate the clown over and over, your discipline has taught you that [color=#66FF00]your objectives must be at least attempted[/color]. For honor!

You start with a microbomb implant, so if you get KIA or seppuku you will leave behind a nice crater and all your precious equipment is kept out of enemy hands.

  You begin implanted with a [color=#a4885c]death acidifier[/color], so if you are KIA or decide to commit seppuku you will leave behind one final gift to the janitor, and all your precious equipment is kept out of enemy hands.

You have a jetpack and pinpointer that will let you find the station.

## Ninja Suit

<GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingOuterSuitSpaceNinja" Captain="ninja suit"/>

Your single most important item is your suit, without it none of your abilities would work.
Your suit requires power to function, its internal battery can be replaced by clicking on it **with a better one**.
You can see the current charge by examining the suit or in a sweet battery alert at the top right of your screen.

If you run out of power and need to recharge your battery, just use your gloves to drain an APC, substation or a SMES.

- You can hack a communications console to call in a threat.
